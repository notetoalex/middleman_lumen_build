    <h3>Comprehensive IP Experience When You Need It Most</h3>
    <p>In today's competitive marketplace, your intellectual property is often your most valuable asset. As a solo patent attorney with extensive experience in both patent prosecution and litigation, I provide the strategic guidance and technical expertise that small businesses and startups need to protect their innovations and build valuable IP portfolios.</p>
    <h3>Why Experience in Both Prosecution and Litigation Matters</h3>
    <p>Most patent attorneys specialize in either getting patents or fighting over them. I do both. This dual expertise means I understand not just how to secure patent protection, but how to build patents that will actually hold up when it matters most. When drafting your applications, I'm thinking ahead to potential enforcement scenarios, creating stronger, more defensible intellectual property from day one.</p>
    <p>My litigation background also means I can spot potential infringement issues early and help you navigate around existing patents, reducing risk and avoiding costly disputes down the road.</p>
    <h3>Broad Technical Expertise Across Industries</h3>
    <p>Innovation doesn't follow industry boundaries, and neither does my practice. I've worked with inventors and companies across a wide range of technologies and subject matter areas, from biotechnology and pharmaceuticals to software and mechanical devices. This diverse experience allows me to quickly understand your technology and identify the key innovations that deserve protection.</p>
    <p>Whether your breakthrough involves complex chemical processes, cutting-edge electronics, software algorithms, or mechanical innovations, I have the technical foundation to protect what makes your invention unique and valuable.</p>
    <h3>Focused on Small Businesses and Startups</h3>
    <p>Growing companies have unique IP needs and constraints. You need efficient, cost-effective strategies that maximize protection while respecting budget realities. My practice is designed specifically for businesses like yours, offering:</p>
    <ul class="bullet-points">
      <li><strong>Flexible engagement models</strong> that work with your budget and timeline</li>
      <li><strong>Strategic patent portfolio development</strong> that grows with your company</li>

      <li><strong>Practical advice </strong>on when to patent, when to rely on trade secrets, and how to build competitive advantages through intellectual property</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Litigation Consulting Available</h3>
    <p>While my primary focus is helping small businesses and startups build strong patent portfolios, I'm also available to consult on intellectual property litigation matters. Whether you're facing an infringement claim, considering enforcement action, or need expert analysis of patent disputes, my litigation experience is available when you need it.</p>
